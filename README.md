# Brand Classification

This project demonstrates the transfer of knowledge from three CNN networks (namely, VGG-19, DenseNet-161, and ResNet-152) pretrained on the ImageNet dataset onto a novel target dataset by finetuning the layers of the networks during the training phase. Additionally, an ensemble model that combines the networks trained via transfer learning is also proposed to further increase the classification accuracy of the base models.

The novel dataset (CL-20) is made up of eleven categories of clothing labels from popular fashion brands. Each category has a total of 200 images, except for one category which has 500 images. Sample images from each category are shown in the image below.
